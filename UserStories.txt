Workflow
1. I want to hide this functionality unless they're logged in
    - First, I need to be able to tell if they're logged in or not
    - Maybe I'll have this currentCustomer thing that I keep track of, that will be null before I log in (So once they 'login', the current customer is not null, and has current customer info)
    - And then once I know that it's not null, then I'll display this menu
2. Prompt the user to log in (if they haven't)
    - I need to go back to the log in menu (of a sort)
    - And then give them log in screen again
3. Prompt them to select which storefront to browse
    - First, I need to grab all storefronts
    - Iterate through the stores and display them
    - Once they select the storefront, save it somewhere so I can query the inventory of the store
4. Once they select a storefront, query the inventory of the storefront
    - Find all inventory that belongs to the storefront
    - Then iterate through that list and display the inventory accordingly
5. Display the storefront inventory with (its quantity, maybe?)
